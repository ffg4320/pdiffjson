# pdiffjson

- [`pdiffjson`](pdiffjson) is a one-liner bash script thatâ€™s non-obvious and useful enough more developers
  should have it at their fingertips.
  It simply combines `jq`, `diff`, `colordiff`, and `less` to normalize and then diff.
- One of the simplest and fastest ways to get prettily printed, colored, paginated diffs of
  JSON files. Ignores all irrelevant whitespace and key ordering on collections objects.
  Just shows you visually whatâ€™s different between two files.
- Not a fancy web UI or a library.
- Works on large files other tools barf on, thanks to `jq`â€™s speed.
- Shows context around each difference in a customizable way, thanks to `diff`.
- Scrollable and searchable output (use space, `/`), thanks to `less`.
- Installs quickly anywhere, thanks to bash.
- Extra bonus [`pjson`](pjson) command that colorizes and pretty-prints only.
- *The feature list is longer than the code!*

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g pdiffjson
```

Or copy the damn bash file to `/usr/local/bin` by hand.
Also ensure you have `jq` and `colordiff` as well (`brew install jq colordiff` on Mac).

## Usage

    $ pdiffjson
    Usage: pdiffjson [diff options] file1.json file2.json

    Show pretty-printed, colored diff of normalized JSON. Uses less to
    paginate the output. Allows a readable diff of any JSON, ignoring all
    non-semantic whitespace.

    This is a "semi-structural diff", meaning it only shows structural
    (semantic) changes but is done syntactically on JSON output, which
    actually makes it more readable and flexible than a true structural
    diff. Works on large files since it relies only on diff and jq.
    Keys are sorted before calling diff, so ordering of keys in collections
    is ignored (as it should be).

    By default calls diff without arguments, yielding a unified diff. But
    it can be helpful to add standard diff arguments to refine the type of
    output, such as:
    -c (contextual diff),
    -C2 (contextual diff with two lines of context), or
    -U5 (unified diff with 5 lines of context).

- [Many websites](https://www.google.com/search?q=json+diff) like
  [jsondiff](https://github.com/zgrossbart/jdd) offer JSON diff functionality but offer no
  command line, donâ€™t work on large files, and are not good for sensitive data.
- [jsondiffpatch](https://github.com/benjamine/jsondiffpatch) is a powerful JavaScript library
  to do JSON diff and patch.
  Has a command line.
  Shows a pure structural diff.
  No semi-structured diff with context.
- [diff-json](https://github.com/andreyvit/json-diff) is another useful JavaScript library with
  a command-line interface.
  Rather slow on larger (multi-megabyte) files, with no incremental output.
- [jd](https://github.com/josephburnett/jd) is a powerful Go command line tool.
  It handles diff and patching.
  It allows more flexible diffs options on arrays (set and bag).
  No colored output or diff output options to show more context, as with diff, so the output
  seems less clear to read.
